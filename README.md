# PyBer_Analysis
Python analysis using MatPlotLib

## Project OverView
PyBer, a ride-sharing app wants to analyze data from January to early May 2019.

1. Calculate the total number of rides.
2. Calculate the total fares.
3. Calculate the total number of drivers.
4. Calculate the average fare per ride for each city type.
5. Calculate the average fare per driver for each city type.
6. Display a summary of total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fares per ride, and average fare per driver by city type.
7. Create a multiple line graph displaying fares by city type from Jan to Early May 2019.

## Resources
- Data Source: city_data.csv, ride_data_csv, PyBer_ride_data.csv
- Software: Python 3.8.2, 
- Visual Studio Code, 1.52.1

## Summary
### The analysis of Pyber share-riding data show that: ![Fare Analysis](analysis/PyBer_fare_summary.png) 

#### The three city types were:
- Urban
- Suburban
- Rural

#### The three factors were:
- Ride counts
- Fare totals
- Number of drivers

##### The analysis results were: ![Fare Average by City Type] (analysis/Total_Fares_Summary.png)
- Urban cities type has the most consistent usage of ride-sharing and potential to make consistent money per driver.
- Followed by suburban cites making about half of what urban cities make.
- Rural cities have a higher fare average than the other city types.

## PyBer Analysis Summary

This analysis shows the differences of users using PyBer amongst city types.  Rural areas lack the traffic for drivers to capitalize in making an income due to less users requesting a ride. I would recommend to reduce prices in rural area and offer incentives for user to use the service.  Secondly, I would reduce the number of drivers allowed in the urban areas to improve a higher fare average.  Lastly, I would offer a low flat rate within a certain mile radius to entice users in all city types to take advantage of the service.
